                   Reporting MUD behavior to vendors
             draft-lear-opsawg-mud-controller-candidates-00

Abstract

   As with other technology, manufacturers would like to understand how
   networks implementing MUD are treating devices that are providing MUD
   URLs and MUD files.  This memo specifies an extension to MUD that
   permits certain behaviors to be reported.

1.  Introduction

   Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) [RFC8520] provides a means for
   devices to identify what they are and what sort of network access
   they need.  When a device with a MUD URL and a MUD file is fielded in
   volume, manufacturers may be curious as to whether it is getting the
   access it needs.  There a few several reasons why a device would not
   be getting the access it needs.  Some examples include:

   o  The MUD file permits access only to a controller but there is
      none.

   o  The MUD file permits access only to same-manufacturer or model but
      there is none.

   o  The MUD file permits access to a particular Internet service, but
      the name of that service has not been resolved (or name resolution
      failed).

   o  The administrator overrode the recommendations in the MUD file.

   This memo sets out to provide manufacturers indications regarding
   what has happened, in a similar vein to how DMARC is usd to report
   message drops to messag senders [RFC7489].

   In order to provide meaningful reporting, it is necessary to indicate
   whether or not the above abstractions are in use at a given time, and
   any public IP addresses that have been mapped to domain names by the
   local deployment.  A communication method that may establish the
   source of the reporter is also necessary, as well as the MUD URL in
   use at the time of the report.

   This memo specifies a YANG model for reporting and a means for
   transmitting the report, and appropriate extensions to the MUD file
   to indicate how to report and how often.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The mud-reporter-extension model extension

   We now formally define this extension.  This is done in two parts.
   First, the extension name "reporter" is listed in the "extensions"
   array of the MUD file.

   Second, the "mud" container is augmented with a container that points
   to where to report and how often.

   This is done as follows:

   module: ietf-mud-controller-candidate
     augment /mud:mud:
         +--rw reporter
             +--rw report-uri    inet:uri
             +--rw frequency?    uint32


   Finally the logging format is defined as follows:

4.  Examples

   TBD

5.  Privacy Considerations

   Using this reporting mechanisms does not reveal internal IP
   addresses.  Instead, it simply indicates whether a given abstraction
   is in use, and how many instances there are.  What is revealed to the
   manufacturer is that one or more devices reporting a particular MUD-
   URL is located at a particular deployment.  In addition, as of this
   draft, reportable events include only administratively dropped
   packets, and the times they were dropped.

   In order to report the sorts of errors discussed in this memo, a
   deployment must determine which packets from a given device have
   either been or would be dropped due to an administrative filter rule.

6.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations of [RFC8520] apply equally to this
   extension.  In addition, some care should be given to claims that a
   device is permitted to be a controller in any given circumstances.
   Complete automation requires far more context than is currently
   specified here.  Some form of confirmation or selection is required
   by an administrator.  This memo simply makes it easier for
   administrator to identify candidates for controller selection.

   IANA Considerations ===================

   The IANA is requested to add "controller-candidate" to the MUD
   extensions registry as follows:

     Extension Name: reporter
